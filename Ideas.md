# Potential Ideas for the Course

- Getting Inside the mind of a FRC Robot Programmer
  - How do I start a task?
  - How do I approach a problem that arised and fix it?
- Functional Interfaces
  - brief introduciton to Java functional interfaces as passing down functions instead of just objects
- odometry for dummies
  - What is Odometry?
  - Why does my odometry suck?
- swerve drive for dummies
  - What is Swerve?
  - Breaking out the Swerve Module as a class (why?)
  - Programming the drive motors
  - Programming the turn motors (oh boy so2 angles here we go)
  - Using WPILib to tell the swerve modules what to
  - Swerve Pains to look out for
    - help I'm driving okay but my robot is going in "random" directions when I try to run auto!
- what is a PID (feedback) loop and why/when - should i use one
- What is Feedforward control and why/when should we use it
  - basics of FF control
  - SysID exists but is garbage
  - does ReCalc work? almost I think
  - FF Tuning a Flywheel
  - FF tuning for an Arm
- FSMs (Finite State Machines) in FRC
    - What is an enumeration or `enum`?
- Creating Clean, Modular, Maintainable 
    - Writing Multiple Subsystems and Multiple Commands
    - Switching between different Auto routines cleanly
    - Dependency Injection
- Chaining Commands Together: Advanced Command Usage and Common pitfalls
    - Look out for Command Requirements ~~can be the worst~~
    - Common Command methods to chain other commands
      - Parallel vs Sequential Command groups
      - Parallel Race and Deadline groups
      - Repeat Commands?
      - honestly a lot of [these methods](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj2/command/Command.html) are really really cool
    - Using `Subsystem` methods to make short but elegant commands in the Subsystem portion
    -
